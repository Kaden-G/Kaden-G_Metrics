# "I am BeyoncÃ©, always." - Michael Scott

Hi! Actually, I am Kaden Godinez

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast (and a huge fan of The Office) who loves building things that help peopleâ€”whether it's making fitness more enjoyable, simplifying workflows, or just connecting folks in fun ways. My journey started as a CommO in the USMC, where I led teams and tackled IT challenges. Now, I'm channeling that experience into software engineering. 

## ðŸŽ“ A Little About Me
- **USMC Veteran**: I served for 8 years as a Communications Officer, managing IT and network operations, and leading diverse teams in some pretty dynamic environments.
- **Program Manager at Workday**: These days, Iâ€™m working at Workday, where I help drive projects that boost operational efficiency. If you are not familiar, they have cutting-edge Human Capital Management software and Financial Management software that makes those tasks WAY easier for companies.
- **Forever Learning**: I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in **Information Systems Engineering** from Johns Hopkins, diving deep into **AI/ML**, **cloud computing**, and **full-stack development**.

## ðŸ’¼ Projects

*Note: Most of these projects are at differing levels of completion and are expected to be finished by the end of this year.*

### 1. Fitness Gamification App
- **Tech Stack**: Django, AWS (EC2, S3)
- **Description**: I'm developing a fitness app with my brother that gamifies habit-building by encouraging social interaction, friendly competition, and teamwork. Itâ€™s all about making fitness accessible, engaging, and fun for everyone involved while using cloud technology to keep things scalable.

### 2. AI/ML Cloud Integration Project (ConnectWise)
- **Tech Stack**: AWS (Lambda, SageMaker, S3), scikit-learn
- **Description**: This project is an AI/ML solution designed to recommend connections within the company based on activities and areas of expertise. It aims to solve a real issue Iâ€™ve seen at workâ€”helping people find who they actually need to reach more easily and efficiently.

### 3. Blackjack Game (Java, Spring Boot)
- **Tech Stack**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Description**: Iâ€™m currently building a classic Blackjack game with Java and Spring Boot. I am looking to improve my backend development skills and get into some game logic. Plus, it lets me explore Spring Boot for managing RESTful services, which is something Iâ€™m really excited to dig deeper into.

## ðŸ”’ Values & Goals
I believe in the **joy of creating**â€”whether it's building something fun, useful, or beautiful, thereâ€™s nothing quite like bringing an idea to life and seeing it help others. Iâ€™m always striving to make technology impactful and enjoyable. Iâ€™m particularly excited about **AI/ML**, **cloud security**, and working alongside others to build projects that matter.

Iâ€™m always up for collaborating, learning, and connecting with others. If youâ€™ve got an idea, want to collaborate, or want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!

## âš¡ Fun Fact
When Iâ€™m not coding or brainstorming new projects, youâ€™ll probably find me hiking around the Bay Area, gaming on my Xbox, trying out new cocktail/mocktail recipes, or cheering at Bay FC home games.

Thanks for checking out my GitHubâ€”let's build something impactful and fun together! ðŸš€# Kaden-G
